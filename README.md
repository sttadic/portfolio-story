## A Journey in Code - Developer Portfolio 🌌

This is a narrative-driven, interactive portfolio website built with React.
It tells the story of my journey into the world of software engineering.

### ✨ Vision

This isn't just a portfolio, it's an experience.
A personal journey told through **metaphors**, **transitions**, **voiceover**, and **emotional storytelling**.

- Visitors aren’t just viewers, they become participants in an unfolding story.
- Each section reflects a part of my real-life transition from one career to another.
- Projects are not just shown, they’re **narrated**, **contextualized**, and **humanized**.
